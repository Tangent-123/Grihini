<br />
Grihini Breaks many Stereotypes. One, it is one of the very few women run enterprise whose core business is based on semi-engineering on one hand and domestic skill on the other hand; thus a healthy mix of accommodating women with varying skill set.

Second, it operates on the principle of women-hours – meaning thereby, that women employees work just for five hours a day thus enjoying both financial independence and family responsibilities.
<br /><br />
Young girls and women relatives are inducted in Grihini, receive in the job training for three months and are absorbed as employees. Most of these employees are owners as well. They are the shareholders of this co-operative society and share the dividends/ fortunes and the risks collectively. Initially started just for female counterparts of Tata Motors employees, Grihini has now opened its platform for other deserving female individuals as well.
