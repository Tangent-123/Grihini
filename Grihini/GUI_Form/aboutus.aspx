<br />
We began in 1973 with mere 7 hesitant women members, extremely limited cash in hand and very humble revenues. But under the able guidance of our visionary mentor Late Ms. Leelatai Moolgaokar, we stand tall with over 1000 women members (most of who are shareholders), 17 centres and over Rs. 79 million turnovers. Grihini Udyog is a collective enterprise which endeavors to empower the women relatives of Tata Motors employees.

<div style="font-family:Arial; font-size:15px; font-weight:bold; color:#646464;">Our philosophy</div> 
<br />
Our work ethics rest on the twin principle of ‘justness’ and ‘ethical’. Justness is ensured through the inbuilt co-operative mode which ensures distribution of dividend in proportion of ones skill set. It is also endured that the Society does not indulge in exploitation of anyone in any manner. Secondly, all labour rights within the ambit of ethical labour practices are secured to the individual members. We belive in ethical outsourcing of labour oriented process.
